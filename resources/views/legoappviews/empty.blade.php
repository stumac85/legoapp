    You have selected parts that are not used in any Lego sets together. Maybe try a different colour for the parts and if unsure of the colour try selecting the part first and 
    then the colour by changing the colour search box to &quot;all&quot;. Also sometimes parts have different grooves and stud configurations. You could try checking rebrickable 
    and conparing studs &amp; connectors to the part you are searching for. Your selections are saved and will appear if you re-visit this page within the next couple of hours.
